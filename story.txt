Last night, I was at the Flughafen and my flight got delayed 9 hours!!
My itinerary consists of visiting Berlin, then making a stop in Raesfeld to visit the countryside.
The whole time I was walking around Berlin, all I could think about was finding a place with Klimaanlage.
I finally found a Baeckerei to cool off in and made some purchases while I was there.
