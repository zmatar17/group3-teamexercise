Last night, I was at the Flughafen and my flight got delayed 9 hours!!
My itinerary consists of visiting Berlin, then making a stop in Raesfeld to visit the countryside.
The whole time I was walking around Berlin, all I could think about was finding a place with Klimaanlage.
I finally found a Baeckerei to cool off in and made some purchases while I was there.
I ended the night at a Biergarten, where a man in a Dirndel challenged me to a pretzel-eating contest—spoiler: I lost. 
As I wiped mustard off my shirt, a dog in Lederhose ran across the Biergarten chasing a Doener someone had dropped.
To recover from my loss, I strolled down Hauptstrasse and treated myself to some warm Gebaeck from a smiling Mehlhase.
I wanted to have apfelkuchen after as well, so I started searching for a baeckerei.
On the way to the baeckerei, I saw a really cool car, a Porsche to be exact.
Finally, I found a really nice baekckerei that was inside of a schloss. 
I was greeted by an adorable hund, which led me to a beautiful dirndel at the counter.
Blushing, I said to her: "Is it hot in here, or is just you?", to which she replied: "No, it actually is hot in here, the klimaanlage is currently broken."
Feeling a wee bit wettbewerbsfaehig, I ripped off my shirt to repair the klimaanlage. 
The dirndel, upon witnessing my epic feat of manliness, uttered: "Ummmm...I'm suddenly in the mood for a bratwurst. I'll catch you later!" and ran out of the store, blushing.
After winning the Lederhose dance-off, I was crowned king of the Biergarten and driven around Berlin in a golden Porsche full of Gebäck.
